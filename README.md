### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


 As a young person determined to step into the business world, I am very interested in the Back-End
 Developer position due to my interest in software and my desire to make a career. I develop projects
 with technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, PostgreSQL, MySQL, JavaScript, TypeScript
 React, Redux and ContextAPI.
 I am success and results oriented, prone to research, eager for both my own and professional
 development, and highly motivated to develop projects and produce new ideas.
 I am improving myself in my career, especially in backend technologies and tools.
